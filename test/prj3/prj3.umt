This document first provides the aims of this project.  It then lists
the requirements as explicitly as possible.  It then hints at how
these requirements can be met.  Finally, it describes how it can be
submitted.

                        Aims
                        ====

The aims of this project are as follows:

  + To give you more exposure to recursive programming.

  + To expose you to Prolog programming.


			    Requirements
			    ============

Implement all the procedures specified in .<prj3-sol/prj3-sol.pro>
prj3-sol.pro using swipl Prolog.  You may define auxiliary procedures
as needed.

An example .<extras/LOG> LOG file gives examples of the use of these
procedures as do the tests provided in .<prj3-sol/prj3-sol.pro>
prj3-sol.pro.

You are not allowed to use any non-logical features of Prolog other
than `is/2`.  Non-logical features include the explicit cut `!`, 
implicit cut within `->`, `assert`, `retract`, `record`, etc.

	    		 Provided Files
			 ==============

You should use the provided .<prj3-sol> prj3-sol directory as a
starting point for your project by copying it into your `i571?/submit`
directory.  It contains the following files:

  : .<prj3-sol/prj3-sol.pro> prj3-sol.pro :
    A skeleton file which contains the specifications for the
    procedures you are required to write as well as tests
    for those procedures.

  : .<./prj3-sol/README> README:
    A README file which must be submitted along with your project.  It
    contains an initial header which you must complete (replace the
    dummy entries with your name, B-number and email address at which
    you would like to receive project-related email).  After the
    header you may include any content which you would like read
    during the grading of your project.

The .<extras> extras directory contains the following files:

  : .<extras/LOG> LOG :
    A sample log file.

  : .<extras/do-tests.sh> do-tests.sh :
    A trivial shell script to allow running tests from the command line.

    	      	      	Tests
			=====

The .<prj3-sol/prj3-sol.pro> prj3-sol.pro skeleton file contains
.<https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/plunit.html%27)>
    "unit tests" for the procedures you are required to implement.
Note that specifying a test as `nondet` means that the test may
succeed with more possible answers pending.  The `all` specification
specifies a list of all possible answers after backtracking through
the test.

You can run the tests using Prolog's `run_tests/0` or `run_tests/1`.

    .code(lang=pro)
    ~~~
    $ prolog
    ...

    % load required solution file
    1 ?- ['prj3-sol.pro'].
    true.

    % run tests for a single procedure
    ?- run_tests(re_match).
    % PL-Unit: re_match ....................... done
    % All 23 tests passed
    true.

    % run all tests
    ?- run_tests.
    % PL-Unit: dept_employees ... done
    % PL-Unit: employees_salary_sum ... done
    % PL-Unit: list_access ............ done
    % PL-Unit: count_non_pairs ....... done
    % PL-Unit: divisible_by .... done
    % PL-Unit: re_match ....................... done
    % PL-Unit: clausal_form ..... done
    % All 57 tests passed
    true.
    ~~~

  You can also use the .<extras/do-tests.sh> do-tests.sh shell script
  to run unit tests from outside prolog:

    .code(lang=sh)
    ~~~
    $ prj3=$HOME/cs571/projects/prj3
    $ $prj3/extras/do-tests.sh
    usage: do-tests.sh TESTS_FILE [TEST_NAME...]
    ~~~

    It can be run for testing a single procedure:

    .code(lang=sh)
    ~~~
    $ $prj3/extras/do-tests.sh prj3-sol.pro re_match
    ...

    % PL-Unit: re_match ... done
    % All 23 tests passed
    % halt
    ~~~

    or for testing multiple procedures:

    .code(lang=sh)
    ~~~
    $ prj3/extras/do-tests.sh prj3-sol.pro re_match divisible_by
    ...

    % PL-Unit: re_match ....................... done
    % PL-Unit: divisible_by .... done
    % All 27 tests passed
    % halt	 
    ~~~

    or for running all tests:

    .code(lang=sh)
    ~~~
    $ $prj3/extras/do-tests.sh prj3-sol.pro 
    ...
    % PL-Unit: dept_employees ... done
    % PL-Unit: employees_salary_sum ... done
    % PL-Unit: list_access ............ done
    % PL-Unit: count_non_pairs ....... done
    % PL-Unit: divisible_by .... done
    % PL-Unit: re_match ....................... done
    % PL-Unit: clausal_form ..... done
    % All 57 tests passed
    % halt
    ~~~

			Hints
			=====

The following points are worth noting:

  + Review the class .<../../slides/prolog/prolog.html> "Prolog
    slides".  In particular, review the slides on
    .<../../slides/prolog/prolog.html#umt-slide-47> "Prolog
    Programming Heuristics".

  + If you do not understand the specs for a procedure, please look at
    the tests or .<extras/LOG> LOG for examples of the expected use of
    the procedure.

  + Pattern matching of two terms can be done implicitly, or by
    explicitly using the `=` operator.  Occasionally, you will need to
    verify that two terms do not match; this can be done using the
    `\=` operator as in `X \= Y`.

    This will be necessary when your case analysis results in
    two cases:

      : *Terms match* :
        The matching is usually done implicitly by using
        the same variable for all occurrences of the terms.

      : *Terms do not match* :
        The terms are accessed as some variables `X` and `Y` and then
	the non-matching is enforced by specifying `X \= Y`, usually
	as a guard.

  + Since there are no types or declarations in Prolog, it is very
    easy to have a bug resulting from a typo in a variable name.
    Prolog tries to prevent this by generating warnings about
    *singleton variables*; i.e, any variable which occurs only once
    within a Prolog rule.  For example, the rule

    .code(lang=prolog)
    ~~~
    member(X, [Element|Elements]) :-
      member(X, Elements).
    ~~~

    would produce a warning that `Element` is a singleton variable.

    If the singleton variable is intentional, then the warning can be
    avoided by replacing the name with one starting with an underscore
    `_`, as in the code shown below:

    .code(lang=prolog)
    ~~~
    member(X, [_Element|Elements]) :-
      member(X, Elements).
    ~~~

  + Prolog has a pretty powerful
    .<https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=debugger>
    "debugging model".  You can turn on tracing using
    `trace/0` or `trace/1` and turn it off using `nodebug/0`, spying on
    a particular procedure using `spy/1` and turn off using `nospy/1`
    of `nospyall`.  If running within a
    graphical environment, you can turn on
    .<https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=guitracer> "GUI
    debugging" using `gtrace`.


			Exercise-Specific Hints
			-----------------------

Exercise #1: `dept_employees()`
===============================

Simply recurse through the list of employees.  Deal with 3 cases:

  # The list of employees is empty.

  # The department in the head of the list of employees matches
    the required department.
    
  # The department in the head of the list of employees does not match
    the required department.

Make sure you set up these 3 cases to be mutually exclusive.

Exercise #2: `employees_salary_sum()`
=====================================

Since the procedure is required to be tail-recursive, use an auxiliary
procedure with an additional parameter which accumulates the sum.

  # If the original employee list is empty, the final sum should simply
    match the accumulated sum.

  # When the original employee list is non-empty, accumulate the head element
    salary into the accumulator and recurse on the cdr.

Use something like `Acc1 is Acc + Salary` to accumulate salaries.

Exercise #3: `list_access()`
============================

You will need to handle the following cases:

  # The `Indexes` list is empty.

  # The `Indexes` list is not empty, but the `List` list is empty.

  # Both lists are not empty and the head of the `Indexes` list is 0.
    In this case, the code will need to descend into the head of
    `List` using the cdr of the `Indexes`.

  # Both lists are not empty and the head `Index` of the `Indexes`
    list is > 0.  In that case, the code will need to step over the
    rest of `List` with a decremented `Indexes` head.  Note that
    something like `Index1 is Index - 1` can be used to perform the
    decrement.

Exercise #4: `count_non_pairs()`
================================

See the corresponding .<../../slides/scheme/scheme.html#umt-slide-78>
Scheme example.  Use the `\=` operator to check that a term is not a pair.

Exercise #5: `divisible_by()`
=============================

This is an exercise in taking advantage of Prolog's backtracking.

Use a *generate-and-test* strategy, using `member/2` to generate
successive elements `X` of the list which are then tested using simply
`0 is X mod N`.

Exercise #6: `re_match()`
=========================

This exercise also takes advantage of Prolog's backtracking.


Define `re_match/2` as a wrapper around an auxiliary `re_match/3`
where the additional argument should represent the leftover suffix
after the regex matches a prefix of the input symbols.  For example,
given a list of input symbols `[a, a, a, b, b]`, then the symbols
leftover after matching the regex `kleene(a)` will be `[b, b]`.  Since
`re_match/2` should match the entire input list of symbols, it will
call `re_match/3` with the additional argument set to `[]`.

Write `re_match/3` using case-analysis on the structure of the regex:

  # If the regex is a symbol `Sym` (checked using `atomic(Sym)`), then
    the head of the input list must match `Sym` with the rest of the
    input list leftover.

  # If the regex is `concat(Re1, Re2)`, then `Re1` must match a
    prefix of the input symbols and `Re2` must match a prefix
    of the symbols leftover after matching `Re1`.

  # If the regex is `alt(Re1, Re2)` then either `Re1` or `Re2`
    must match a prefix of the input symbols.  Use separate
    rules for each alternate.

  # If the regex is `kleene(Re)`, then `Re` can match successive
    prefixes of the input symbols repeatedly, or it can simply match
    the empty prefix of the input symbols.

Exercise #7: `clausal_form()`
=============================

This exercise asks you to convert a Prolog program represented as
a list of rules into one which uses explicit logical connectives
(`/\` for logical-and, `\/` for logical-or and `~` for logical
negation):

  + The input list of rules `[Rule1, Rule2, ..., RuleN]` represents a
    logical-and of the rules in the list.  Hence the input list should be
    converted to `RuleZ1 /\ RuleZ2 /\ ... /\ RuleZN`, where `RuleZ`"i"
    is the conversion of each individual rule.

  + A rule which is a fact (there is no body) does not need to change.

  + A rule which has a body will match the Prolog term `Head :- Body`.
    This will need to be converted into `Head \/ BodyZ`, where `BodyZ`
    is the conversion of `Body`.

  + A `Body` of the form `P1, P2, ..., Pn` will need to be converted
    to `~P1 \/ ~P2 \/ ... \/ Pn`

The conversions for an individual rule follows from the fact
that `:-` stands for logical implication and `Head :- Body` is the
same as `Head \/ ~Body`.  Specifically,

     $$$
     \begin{array}{lll}
       & \texttt{Head :- P1, P2,}\;\ldots\texttt{, Pn}\\
     \equiv & \texttt{Head \\/ ~( P1 /\\ P2 /\\} \ldots \texttt{/\\ Pn )}\\
     \equiv & \texttt{Head \\/ ~P1 \\/ ~P2 \\/}\ldots\texttt{\\/ ~Pn}
	 & \textrm{using De Morgan's Law}\\	  
     \end{array}
     $$$

At first glance, this appears to be a fairly straightforward conversion
between different operators.  However, there is a problem in that
the operators have different associativities:

  + The implicit pair operator `[|]` used with lists is right-associative
    whereas `/\` is left-associative.  For example, `[Rule1, Rule2, Rule3]`
    has the structure:

    
    .visjs(syntax=trees, class="xxx",
           options="{ height: 400 }")
    ---
    ["[|]"
     [Rule1]
     ["[|]"
      [Rule2]
      ["[|]" [Rule3] ["[]"]]]]
    ---

    but the output structure should be:


    .visjs(syntax=trees, class="xxx",
           options="{ height: 400 }")
    ---
    ["/\\" ["/\\" [Rule1] [Rule2]]  [Rule3] ]
    ---

  + Similarly, the comma operator `,` used between the predicates of a
    rule body is right-associative whereas `\/` is left-associative.
    Hence `Pred1, Pred2, Pred3` has the structure

    .visjs(syntax=trees, class="xxx",
           options="{ height: 400 }")
    ---
    ["," [Pred1] ["," [Pred2] [Pred3]]]
    ---

    but the desired output structure is
  

    .visjs(syntax=trees, class="xxx",
           options="{ height: 400 }")
    ---
    ["\\/" ["\\/" ["~Pred1"] ["~Pred2"]]  ["~Pred3"] ]
    ---

The solution to this problem is to accumulate the output using an
accumulating parameter.  Here is a possible start for the code:

.code(lang=prolog)
~~~
clausal_form([Rule|Rules], Form) :- %List of rules specified non-empty
    rule_clause(Rule, RuleClause),
    clausal_form(Rules, RuleClause, Form).

clausal_form([], AccForm, AccForm).
clausal_form([Rule|Rules], AccForm, Form) :-
    rule_clause(Rule, RuleClause),
    clausal_form(Rules, AccForm /\ RuleClause, Form).
~~~

where `rule_clause(Rule, RuleClause)` will convert `Rule` (in Prolog
syntax) to `RuleClause` in logic syntax.

While writing the code, it is important to keep in mind that Prolog's
`:-` and `,` operators have low precedences.  Hence attempting to
match `:-` using something like `rule_clause(Head:-Body, ...)` will
cause a syntax error; instead you must use something like
`rule_clause((Head:-Body), ...)`.  Similar parenthesization is
necessary when matching the comma operator.
